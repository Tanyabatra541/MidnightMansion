# Midnight Mansion Login

## If I had more time

- Make the UI more aesthetic
- Add functionalities for forgot your password and register (multi-screen flow)
- Add animations
- Add a password visibility toggle
- Add testing

This repo will be home to your Midnight Mansion coding interview.

## Project

This project started with [nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app).

- `npm install` will install dependencies (do not use Yarn if that's something you've used recently)
- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server.

## Getting Started

We've set up this repository with Typescript and Scss as they are what we use. However, if you feel more comfortable using vanilla javascript and css, feel free to ignore them. You should be able to proceed as if they are not there. We do not expect you to learn Typescript and Scss during this assessment.

Under `src` you'll find `App.tsx`, which will be your home page and where you should implement the login flow. We've provided some starter components and linked appropriate stylesheets for your convience. Feel free to add more components if you find them necessary.

## Custom port

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a port for development. To do this, you can run `npm start` with an additional flag:

```
npm start -- --port 1234
```
